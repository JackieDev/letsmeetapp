# shadcn/ui Component Guidelines

This project uses **shadcn/ui** for all UI elements and components.

## Initialization

If shadcn/ui is not initialized in the project, use:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

When a specific component is needed but not yet installed, use the shadcn CLI to add it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

**Examples:**
- Button: `npx shadcn@latest add button`
- Card: `npx shadcn@latest add card`
- Dialog: `npx shadcn@latest add dialog`
- Form: `npx shadcn@latest add form`
- Input: `npx shadcn@latest add input`

## Important Notes

- **Always** use shadcn/ui components for UI elements rather than creating custom components from scratch
- Check if a component exists in the shadcn/ui library before building custom alternatives
- Components are installed into the project (typically `components/ui/`) and can be customized as needed
- Refer to [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com) for available components and their usage
